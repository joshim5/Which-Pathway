#This is the classical abc model. 
#Perturbations are used:
#-> to introduce the C(s)
#-> to catch only the first 10 instances of a Cpp formation. 

#2 stories can occur 
#1) Both sites of C have been activated by the same A 
#2) Both sites of C have been activated but by different A(s)

#The first one is very unlikely and does not occur with this seed.
