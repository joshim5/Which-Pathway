#The observable is triggerred when there is a B that is free and a C that is free and not phosphorilated. 

#This requires
# 1) the introduction of a dimmer AB
# 2) the separation of a dimmer AB 
# The B becomes free by side-effects. 
# 2) the separation of two connected Cs. 
# The unsphorilated C becomes free by side-effects. 

#There are two causal flows, depending whether the dimmer AB is in the initial state or introduced at run time. 

#In case of erroneous result, 
#check how side-effects are dealt with in the frontend. 
#and how observables are detected.
