#The observable is triggerred when there is a B that is bound and a C that is free and not phosphorilated. 

#This requires
# 1) the introduction of a dimmer AB
# 2) the separation of two connected Cs. 
# The unsphorilated C becomes free by side-effects. 

#There is only one causal flow. 

#In case of erroneous result, 
#check how side-effects are dealt with in the frontend. 
#and how observables are detected.
