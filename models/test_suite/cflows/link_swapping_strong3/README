#In this model As can form a dimmer by connecting their two x(s), and
#their two y(s) concurrently.
#Then, they can swap these links to bind a site x to the site y of the
#other A, and vice versa (which triggers the observable).

#There is only one causal flow.

#KaSim will fails if actions are not interpreted in the proper order
#in strong compression
