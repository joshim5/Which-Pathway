#A and B can for dimmer.
#A can release its link. 

#After a given time, releasing a link can produce a C. 

#The observable require A to be associated with the specific B and C to exist. 

#Causal flows can be compressed in 
#A and (specific) B unbind which creates a C, then A and the specific B rebind. 

#This compression can be achieved only by playing the event unbind A and creates C in a different context. 
#(Which is OK since it is a side-effect and we do no track the identity of the released partner).
