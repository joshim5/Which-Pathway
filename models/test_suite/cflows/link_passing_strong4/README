#In this model K can connect to A on x. 
#Then the link can be pass from A.x to A.y, and from A.y to A.z. 

#There is only one causal flow. 

#KaSim will fails if actions are not interpreted in the proper order in cflow/kappa_instantiation.ml or if link passing with fixed agents is wrongly handled in strong comprssion.
