#In this examples, free A can turn into free B, which can turn into free C, which can turn into free A
#Each agent has a site x
#E can un/bind C
#E bound to C can get bound to A

#There is only one strongly compressed story. 

#It may fail when link swapping when all three involved agents except the one that is bound and remain bound can be substituted are not handled properly
