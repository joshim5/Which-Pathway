#A and B can for dimmer.
#Each time A and B forms a dimmer the state of A is changed from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0. 

#At the beggining A is bound to a specific B, but A has state 0. 
#The observable require A to have state 0 and be associated with the specific B.

#Causal flows can be compressed in 
#A and (specific) B unbind, and bind again.
