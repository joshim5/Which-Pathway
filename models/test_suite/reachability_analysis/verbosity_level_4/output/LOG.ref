------------------------------------------------------------
* Dead rule :
------------------------------------------------------------
rule 7: KO will never be applied.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
In agent A, the internal state of site x, the internal state of site y, and the internal state of site z, are entangled by the following 3-d relationship:
	A(x~q,y~u,z~u)
	A(x~q,y~q,z~q)
	A(x~q,y~q,z~u)
	A(x~0,y~p,z~q)
	A(x~p,y~u,z~u)
	A(x~p,y~p,z~u)
	A(x~u,y~u,z~u)

------------------------------------------------------------
* Non relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
The internal state of site z in agent A ranges over u and q.
The internal state of site y in agent A ranges over u, p, and q.
The internal state of site x in agent A ranges over u, p, 0, and q.
